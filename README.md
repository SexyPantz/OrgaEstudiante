# TP Orga II: Lista doblemente enlazada en Assembly
---------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------


## UPDATE 10/04/2015
--------------------
	*First implementation of filtrarLista (UNFINISHED)
	*First implementation of insertarOrdenado (NOT TESTED)
	*I feel lonley and sad all the time
	*I live with a constant existential crisis
	*All implemented functions work with allined stacks
	*Am I really alive or is this just an illusion?
	*I hope there is a god and he/she/it can hear me
	*I don't want to exist forever, yet I do want to exist forever
	*I'm really scared by the fact that there may not be and "after-life"
	*I desperatly want someone to connect with
	*Death is an undivorceable part of life, that thought makes my unimaginably miserable    
	*Hate myself and I often think of myself as weak or unworthy of others affection



## UPDATE 10/04/2015
--------------------
	*borraLista works fine
	*Fixed stack related bug in borrarNodo 
	*Realigned stack pointer in all functions
	*First implementation of altalistaImprimir (TESTED)
	*Fixed wrong push sequence in imprimierEstudiante
	*I hate my life

### NOTES
---------
 - Issues with borrarLista were actually caused by disorganized pushes and unaligned stacks pointer in several other functions. 
 - Also, recent indepth sould searching made me cuestion if I have bad luck with girls or if im just dumb as fuck. Some more souls searching later on revealed its usually the latter.... :(





## UPDATE 09/04/2015
--------------------
	* borrarLista still won't work properly, reason unknown.
	* Half-assed implementation of edadMedia, won't work either.
